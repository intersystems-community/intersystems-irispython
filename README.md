}

with dbapi.connect(**config) as conn:
    with conn.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("select ? as one, 2 as two", 1)   # second arg is parameter value
        for row in cursor:
            one, two = row

```python
import intersystems_iris.dbapi._DBAPI as dbapi

config = {
    "embedded": True,

}

with dbapi.connect(**config) as conn:
    with conn.cursor() as cursor:
        sql = "select ? as one, ? as two union all select ?, ?"
        params = [1, 2, 3, 4]
        cursor.execute(sql, params)
        for row in cursor:
            one, two = row
            print(f"one: {one}")
            print(f"two: {two}")
```
